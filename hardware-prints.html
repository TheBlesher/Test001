On inputs 8 and 9 we will connect CN180LC2 and on 10 and 11 we will have CN180LC3. This means we need to add 3 light curtains to our simulation. The robot E-stops will be connected the same way, each channel will go to a different input, the only difference is that they will be daisy-chained, meaning that all robots channel 1 will be connected to the same input and the other channel of every robot in the array will go to the next input.

                    <h5>We have two clamps “Pin clamp 1” and “Clamp 1”. The individual valves such as “Pin clamp C05A” and “Pin Clamp C06A” are connected to the same clamp in the manifold meaning they will move together. This diagram is of the pneumatic manifold, and it shows the control of air flow. It shows the initial position, what type of clamps are used, and how many clamps there are. This is PM1 you can see the name of the PM underneath the clamp name and its positions.  </h5>

                     <h5>As you can see, in PM1 we only have 2 valves, this means we will drive two valves from that manifold.   
                    <br>Each grouping has one valve. Since the valve is what changes the air flow it makes them move together. The valve name and the clamps it includes are boxed in green. For example Pin Clamp 1 includes C06A and C05A.

                    <br>
                    <h5>The most common valve is the 2-way one, but sometimes you can find 1 and 3-way ones. Make sure to add the right one when doing your simulation file. Both of the valves in our example are 2 way valves.  
                    <br>Each valve type has a distinct purpose and layout. The one way valve was one position where is is pushing air in and one where it is allowing air out. The arrows within the valve show the direction of air flow allowed, the lines will line up and connected to the clamps. The flat line on top of the incoming line means that the line is blocked off. For example, the middle position on the 3 way valve blocks air flow in either direction. The 1 and 3 way valves have tension applied such as a spring force, this is shown by the zig zag line on the side which it puts pressure. The 3 way valve applies equal pressure to either side meaning when not given an input it will sit in the middle slot. The 1 way valve has a spring on one side meaning when no input is applied it will return to its starting position. The 2 way valve has no springs. These differences help to determine which type of valve is being used.

                     <h5>On WinMOD side (and in the real world), this means we will have 4 different connections to the I/O block per set of clamps in this case (because we have different clamp states) and only 2 connections per valve on the manifold (because we are only driving one valve). The different clamp states are at home and at work. Each individual clamp has an at home and at work state. So for the pin clamp we have at home and at work twice since one correlates to C05A and the other to C06A. You can see in the image for BK01 a couple images above which specific input corresponds with C05A and C06A. </h5>
                    <br>
                    <h5>There are also stations that consist of a specific device like a rack, conveyor, SISO, etc. Usually, we already have an item designed to simulate this kind of device, but still you will need to make sure the connections are done properly because often they are unique between cells and stations. Often the mapping of the part presents, sensors, and clamps change. Always go into the station layout and look at the block connections and compare them to the device connections on the provided item. Sometimes an entire block will be added, removed, or renamed. This may mean you need to manually generate the internal block tags as the ones made from the device tag generation will be inaccurate.   </h5>
                    <br>
                    <h5>This time we have such stations, CN190T01 is a SISO cart and CA010T01 and CA010T02 are conveyors. The naming for these conveyors is different because they belong to the next station, still we handle the loading of parts on them. They will have the name of the cell they end in. There can be load only, unload only, and full conveyors. Full conveyors are less common. You can often see which it is by the prints, what parts are called, naming in the prints, as well as looking at where the conveyor is in the line layouts. They are usually fairly easy to see as large green blocks in or between cells. The conveyor name and type is based off which part the current cell controls, an unload conveyor only unloads parts/receives them from another cell from before it, a load conveyor only loads parts to send to the next cell, and a full conveyor both loads and unloads parts typically used to move parts across the cell to reset the position of the line. </h5>

                    <h5>These are Accumulating conveyors with electric rotary stops. Instead of using clamps to hold the pallets, this conveyor uses 2 and 3 position rotary stops to hold and release the pallets. On one side we have the pre-load and load stops, and on the other we have the pre-unload and unload stops, and in the middle, we have mid stop 1 and mid stop 2. Each stop will hold or release the pallet depending on what’s needed. Only the load and unload have 3 positions, using this third position to lock the pallet in place to pick/drop the part. Depending on the size a conveyor can have up to 8 mid stops.</h5>
                    <br>
                    <h5>The connections are distributed and by looking at the prints you can tell what is handled by the load and what by the unload. We have 1 IDC1, 2 SBKs and 5 BKs.  </h5>

                    <h5>By looking at both SBK11 and SBK12, we can tell that IDC1 and BK04 are connected to SBK11, and BK02 and BK05 are connected to SBK12.  </h5>
                    <br>
                    <img src="assets/img/hardware/016.png" alt="post" class="img1">
                    <h5>By looking at BK02 we can tell this block handles the load side, and then on BK01’s input 14 we have the Load stop in position, meaning this block is handled by the load side. On the other side, we can see BK03 and BK04 have inputs and outputs related to the unload side. These blocks were not included in this document but can be found in the conveyor prints. </h5>
                    <br>
                    <h5>This means that SBK11, BK03, BK04 and IDC1 are handled by the unload side and SBK12, BK01, BK02 and BK05 are handled by the load side.</h5>
                    <br>
                    <h5>Knowing this we can go into our WinMOD macro and make sure it has the right connections, most of the time the stops are in the same place, and you might only need to modify the part present mapping.</h5>
                    <br>
                    <h5>For the SISO this time we didn’t get a print for the element itself and only for the “cart’s table”, meaning this is a standard SISO and we only need to pay attention to the table/fixture connections. PPE09 and PP10 are option specific, meaning they will turn on based on certain options related with the part being build. For this option you need to add a special bit that you will receive from the plc each time a part has those conditions. For convenience you can use a User Defined Bit belonging to any robot (because they are already mapped into the PLC and also in WinMOD). </h5>
